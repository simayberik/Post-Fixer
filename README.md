# Post-Fixer
The aim of the project is to develop a one-player game about postfix expressions. 
# General Info
The game is played on a 10*10 board with different modes. Board elements are numbers (1-9) and 4 operations (*, +, /, -). These 
elements are added to the game from an input queue. The aim of the game is to form postfix expressions by 
using board elements and getting the highest score. For more information about game rules please read the game file.
# Required Tools
-Add Java Enigma to your system and add it to your library path.
# Enigma
Enigma is a Java Console Library written by Ethan Royael Nicholas. It is a Java-based operating system which is currently in the very early stages of development. The Enigma Console API is the first component of Enigma to be completed. It is a full-featured text-mode API for Java which can be used on any platform, with any program. It will ultimately serve as Enigma's text-mode API, but will remain pure Java and therefore be compatible with all Java-capable platforms.
