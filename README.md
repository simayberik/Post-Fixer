# Post-Fixer
The aim of the project is to develop a one-player game about postfix expressions. 
# General Info
The game is played on a 10*10 board with different modes. Board elements are numbers (1-9) and 4 operations (*, +, /, -). These 
elements are added to the game from an input queue. The aim of the game is to form postfix expressions by 
using board elements and getting the highest score. For more information about game rules please read the game file.
